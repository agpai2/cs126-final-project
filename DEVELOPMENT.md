# Progress
### 11/20
- Generated hexagonal grid graphics
- Tracked and displayed number of atoms in individual cell
- Added listener to mouse clicks which increment number of atoms in a cell

# Issues / TODO
### 11/20
- ofxMSAInteractive object is a rectangle (but I need a hexagon), current workaround is to have a clickable rectanglular area in the middle of the cell
- String displaying number of atoms is not centered in cell
- HexGrid::setup() is too long
